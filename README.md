# olingo-spring

Practice project using [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Olingo](https://olingo.apache.org/) to
expose a simple API.

## Starting the API

To start the API locally using a bootable JAR:

```
gradle bootRun
```

This will launch the API at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Running the tests

```
gradle test
```

NOTE: TODO FIXME This is not currently working from command line, but it does work in IDEA.
